                  Mark was once a bartender, a rock climbing instructor, and traveled around the US of A before he decided to focus his attention on learning about software development and tricking a rock to think. When he isn't refactoring code he likes to write music, watch movies and cook food for friends and family.

                  Hi,I am Rumeysa Ulug,
I truly enjoyed  the time in the Tech Elevator as Java student where I not only learn but also create which makes me feel really excited. Before Tech Elevator I was a Math teacher for nine years and I am thankful for every family who has invited me to be a part of their childrenâ€™s lives. I will be continuing my journey as a developer who build things human-centered and with creative design.

                  Programming made such an impact on me with how it provided a limitless environment that allowed me to express my imagination to create solutions for problems I would never have thought of. Serving in the military gave me the love for working with a team, and with my education from Tech Elevator, I am eagerly searching to be a part of a company that allows me to use my passions to have an impact in the field of tech.
